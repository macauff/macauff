def set_list(aindices, bindices, aoverlap, boverlap, n_pool):
    '''
    Creates the inter-catalogue groupings between catalogues "a" and "b", based
    on previously determined individual source "overlaps" in astrometry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    aindices : numpy.ndarray
        The indices into catalogue "b", for each catalogue "a" source, that have
        been determined to be potentially positionally correlated.
    bindices : numpy.ndarray
        The equivalent to ``aindices``, but mapping the overlaps in catalogue "a"
        for each catalogue "b" source.
    aoverlap : numpy.ndarray
        The number of overlaps for each catalogue "a" source (i.e., the length
        of each row in ``aindices`` for each source).
    boverlap : numpy.ndarray
        The equivalent number of overlaps for each catalogue "b" object.
    n_pool : integer
        Number of multiprocessing pools to use when parallelising.

    Returns
    -------
    alist : numpy.ndarray
        The indices of all catalogue "a" sources that are in a common "island"
        group together. Each row of ``alist`` indicates all "a" sources
        potentially positionally correlated.
    blist : numpy.ndarray
        The indices of all catalogue "b" objects in the same groups (as other
        "b" sources, as well as mapping to catalogue "a" objects).
    agrouplengths : numpy.ndarray
        The number of catalogue "a" sources in each unique "island".
    bgrouplengths : numpy.ndarray
        The number of catalogue "b" sources in each island grouping.
